Then other players start placing their assets on unoccupied territories according to their rolled numbers.&#10;- After all territories are occupied each player adds additional assets to their occupied territories and there is no limit for adding assets to a single territory.&#10;- When there are no armies left, risk cards are shuffled and the first player starts the game.&#10;&#10;GamePlay &#10;Each turn consists of 3 stages:&#10;1.Getting and placing new armies.&#10;2.Attacking.&#10;3.Fortifying position.&#10;&#10;1.Getting and Placing New Armies&#10;At the beginning of each turn players receive new armies based on the number of  territories they occupied, value of the continents they hold , value of the matched set cards and other bonuses like the number of capitals they hold. &#10;&#10;Territories &#10;Players receive armies according to their occupied territories divided by three. Players can place their armies on their already occupied territories. Players will receive at least 3 armies even if their occupied territories are less than 9. &#10;&#10;Continents&#10;Players receive armies for each continent they hold. In order to hold a continent, players must occupy all the territories on the continent. Each continent has its own bonus points and it activates after the player holds a continent at the beginning of his/her turn.The number of extra armies for each continent:&#10;Asia: 7&#10;North America: 5&#10;Europe: 5&#10;Africa: 3&#10;South America: 2&#10;Australia: 2 &#10;&#10;Capitals&#10;Each player chooses a capital at the beginning of the game after all the initial soldiers are placed that cannot be changed during the game session. This capital gives 2 bonus points while the player is still controlling the territory. If a player attacks and invades another player’s capital, it gains the bonus points given by the capital.&#10;&#10;Risk Cards&#10;At the end of a turn in which the player captures at least one territory, the player gains one risk card. The main goal is to collect sets of 3 cards in one of the combinations:&#10;&#9;-3 cards of the same type(Infantry, Cavalry, or Artillery)&#10;&#9;-1 from each type(Infantry, Cavalry, and Artillery)&#10;&#9;-Any 2 cards and a wild card.&#10;At the beginning of each turn players who have a set of cards that are one the above conditions can trade their set with armies. Each set has its own value in terms of troops. Wild cards are like joker cards, if a player has 2 artillery cards, it behaves like the third artillery card and provides a set.&#10;&#10; 2.Attacking&#10;When a player’s turn comes he/she can attack other players’ territories. The main goal of attacking is to capture an opponent's territory by defeating all the armies that are currently on the territory. The defeater of the battle is decided by roll of dice. The players may choose not to attack when their turn comes but can still fortify their armies.In order to attack the player should satisfy the following conditions:&#10;&#9;-The player can only attack a territory which is next to or connected to his/her territory.&#10;&#9;-The player must have at least 2 armies in the territory which he/she attacks from.&#10;The player can attack a territory till there are no opponent’s armies left. Also, the player can attack territories as much as possible and can switch from one territory to another during his/her turn.&#10;&#10;Dice rolls&#10;Players will roll two dice which have 10 faces that gives the player a total number of 100 different possibilities. The player that rolls the highest number wins the round and if there is an advantage to one of the players, the player uses the best of two rolls to fight. &#10;&#10;Capturing Territories&#10;When there are no opponent’s armies left where the territory that the player has attacked, he/she captures the territory. In this territory, remaining armies from the previous battle are placed. The player must leave at least one army on the territory that he/she has attacked from.&#10;&#10;Ending Attacks&#10;The player can end his/her attacks when desired. If the player has captured at least one territory he/she takes a one risk card.&#10;&#10;Eliminating an Opponent&#10;When the player eliminates all armies of another player, the second player is eliminated from the game and the first player gets all the cards that the second player has previously owned.&#10;&#10;3.Fortifying Position&#10;While always leaving one army behind, the player may choose to fortify their armies from only one territory into only one other territory that is his/hers. There are no requirements to fortify armies.&#10;&#10;Winning&#10;The player who captures all the territories wins the game." textOverrun="CENTER_WORD_ELLIPSIS" wrapText="true" />
